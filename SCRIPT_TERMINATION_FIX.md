# Script Termination Fix - Root Cause Analysis & Solution

## Issue Description
Scripts would continue running in the background even after clicking the "Stop" button in the UI. This particularly affected long-running processes like development servers (`npm start`, `webpack-dev-server`, etc.).

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Incomplete Process Tree Termination**
- **Problem**: The original code only killed the immediate parent process
- **Impact**: Child processes spawned by scripts (like webpack-dev-server, live-reload servers) continued running
- **Root Cause**: On Windows, killing a parent process doesn't automatically kill child processes

### 2. **Shell Process Intermediation**
- **Problem**: Using `shell: true` creates intermediate shell processes
- **Impact**: Created a process hierarchy that made termination more complex
- **Root Cause**: The immediate child is often a shell, not the actual target process

### 3. **Race Conditions in State Management**
- **Problem**: UI state wasn't immediately updated when stopping scripts
- **Impact**: Users could trigger multiple stop attempts
- **Root Cause**: Async operations without immediate UI feedback

## Solution Implementation

### 1. **Enhanced Process Tree Termination**
```typescript
const killProcessTree = async (pid: number): Promise<boolean> => {
  if (process.platform === 'win32') {
    // Use taskkill to kill entire process tree on Windows
    exec(`taskkill /F /T /PID ${pid}`, ...)
    // Fallback: Find and kill child processes manually
    exec(`wmic process where "ParentProcessId=${pid}" get ProcessId`, ...)
  } else {
    // On Unix systems, kill the process group
    process.kill(-pid, 'SIGTERM');
    setTimeout(() => process.kill(-pid, 'SIGKILL'), 2000);
  }
}
```

### 2. **Improved Process Spawning**
- **Windows**: Added `windowsVerbatimArguments: false` for better argument handling
- **Unix**: Used `detached: true` to create new process groups for easier termination
- Enhanced environment variable handling to prevent Node.js environment bleeding

### 3. **Better State Management**
- Added `stoppingScripts` state to track scripts being terminated
- Immediate UI feedback when stop button is clicked
- Visual indicators (spinner, "Stopping..." text) during termination
- Disabled action buttons during stopping to prevent race conditions

### 4. **Graceful vs Force Termination**
```typescript
// Try graceful shutdown first
if (process.platform === 'win32') {
  childProcess.kill('SIGINT');  // CTRL+C on Windows
} else {
  childProcess.kill('SIGTERM'); // SIGTERM on Unix
}

// Wait 2 seconds, then force kill if needed
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

if (!gracefulShutdown) {
  await killProcessTree(pid); // Force kill entire tree
}
```

## Update: Node.js Port Issue Resolution

### Problem Identified
After initial testing, we discovered that Node.js processes (like `pnpm dev`) were still not being terminated completely. The "address already in use" error indicated that child processes (webpack dev server, etc.) were still holding onto ports even after the parent process was killed.

### Root Cause - Deeper Analysis
1. **Windows Process Tree Management**: Windows doesn't automatically kill child processes when a parent dies, unlike Unix systems
2. **Node.js Process Spawning**: Tools like `pnpm`, `npm`, `webpack` create multiple child processes that aren't properly tracked
3. **Port Binding**: Node.js servers bind to ports in child processes that remain even after main process termination
4. **Insufficient Process Discovery**: The previous WMIC approach wasn't reliably finding all child processes

### Enhanced Solution Implementation

#### 1. **Improved Child Process Discovery**
```typescript
const getChildProcessIds = async (parentPid: number): Promise<number[]> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    exec(`wmic process where "ParentProcessId=${parentPid}" get ProcessId /format:csv`, (error, stdout) => {
      // Parse CSV format output more reliably
      const lines = stdout.split('\n');
      const pids: number[] = [];
      
      for (const line of lines) {
        const parts = line.split(',');
        if (parts.length >= 2) {
          const pidStr = parts[1]?.trim();
          const pid = parseInt(pidStr, 10);
          if (!isNaN(pid) && pid > 0) {
            pids.push(pid);
          }
        }
      }
      
      resolve(pids);
    });
  });
};
```

#### 2. **Recursive Process Tree Killing**
```typescript
// Get all child processes recursively
const allPids = new Set<number>([pid]);
const toCheck = [pid];

while (toCheck.length > 0) {
  const currentPid = toCheck.pop()!;
  const childPids = await getChildProcessIds(currentPid);
  
  for (const childPid of childPids) {
    if (!allPids.has(childPid)) {
      allPids.add(childPid);
      toCheck.push(childPid); // Check this child's children too
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Comprehensive Kill Strategy**
```typescript
// Kill individual processes
const killPromises = pidsArray.map(pidToKill => {
  return new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    exec(`taskkill /F /PID ${pidToKill}`, (error) => {
      // Handle errors gracefully
      resolve();
    });
  });
});

// Also try tree kill as backup
const treeKillPromise = new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
  exec(`taskkill /F /T /PID ${pid}`, () => resolve());
});

await Promise.all([...killPromises, treeKillPromise]);
```

#### 4. **Process Verification**
```typescript
// Verify if the process is actually gone
const processStillExists = await new Promise<boolean>((resolve) => {
  exec(`tasklist /FI "PID eq ${pid}"`, (error, stdout) => {
    if (error || !stdout.includes(`${pid}`)) {
      resolve(false); // Process is gone
    } else {
      resolve(true); // Process still exists
    }
  });
});
```

#### 5. **Extended Graceful Timeout**
- Increased graceful shutdown timeout from 3 to 5 seconds for Node.js processes
- Added process verification before force-killing
- Better environment variables for Node.js process management

## Files Modified

### Backend (Main Process)
- `src/main/main.ts`: Enhanced script termination logic with process tree killing

### Frontend (Renderer Process)
- `src/renderer/contexts/AppContext.tsx`: Added stopping state management
- `src/renderer/components/ScriptsTab.tsx`: Enhanced UI with stopping indicators
- `src/renderer/components/ScriptsTab.css`: Added CSS for stopping animations

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start Development Server**: Run `pnpm start` to start the application
2. **Create Test Script**: Add a long-running script like `npm run dev` or `python -m http.server`
3. **Run Script**: Click the play button to start the script
4. **Stop Script**: Click the stop button
5. **Verify Termination**: 
   - Check that the UI immediately shows "Stopping..." status
   - Verify that background processes are actually terminated
   - On Windows: Use Task Manager to confirm no orphaned processes
   - On Unix: Use `ps aux | grep <process>` to verify termination

## Final Testing Results

⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: While the initial fix worked for simple processes, a **critical flaw** was found with Node.js development tools like `pnpm dev`, `npm start`, etc.

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis - Deeper Investigation:

**The Problem**: Parent processes (like `pnpm`) were terminating gracefully with SIGINT, but **child processes (actual Node.js servers) were left running**, causing "address already in use" errors.

**Evidence from Real Test**:
```log
[1] Script f5588278-95fa-433c-9134-3c89d3aef081 exited with code: null, signal: SIGINT ✅
[1] Script process f5588278-95fa-433c-9134-3c89d3aef081 terminated gracefully ✅
[1] Script f5588278-95fa-433c-9134-3c89d3aef081 terminated gracefully, no force kill needed ❌ WRONG!

// Restart attempt:
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 127.0.0.1:5000 ❌

// Investigation showed:
TCP 127.0.0.1:5000 LISTENING 19820 (node.exe still running) ❌
```

**Discovery**: Found **12 orphaned Node.js processes** running after testing! 

### 🛠️ **ENHANCED FIX - Complete Solution**:

#### 1. **Always Check for Child Processes**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only checked if parent failed to terminate
if (!gracefulShutdown || processStillExists) {
  killProcessTree(pid);
}

// AFTER: Always check for living descendants
const childPids = await getChildProcessIds(pid);
const allDescendantPids = await getAllDescendants(childPids);
const hasLivingDescendants = allDescendantPids.size > 0;

if (!gracefulShutdown || processStillExists || hasLivingDescendants) {
  killProcessTree(pid);
  killAllDescendants(allDescendantPids);
}
```

#### 2. **Recursive Child Process Discovery**
- Finds children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren recursively  
- Uses improved CSV parsing for reliable WMIC output
- Builds complete process family tree before termination

#### 3. **Dual Termination Strategy**
- Primary: Process tree kill with `taskkill /T`
- Backup: Individual kill for each discovered descendant
- Ensures no process escapes cleanup

#### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
- Shows exact number of descendants found
- Logs which processes need termination
- Tracks success/failure of each kill attempt

### ✅ **VERIFIED SOLUTION**:
