## Implementation Approach

### Design Philosophy
- **Power User Focused**: Streamlined interface prioritizing efficiency and advanced features for experienced developers
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical functionality and UI across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Basic Integrations**: Focus on essential integration features - provide core functionality without deep complexity (e.g., Git status and basic actions, not conflict resolution)
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Phased rollout allowing for user feedback and iterative improvement
- **Efficiency Over Simplicity**: Optimize for productivity and quick access to advanced features rather than beginner-friendly interfaces

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (High Impact, Lower Complexity)
1. Global Settings Page UI
2. Advanced Script Management (output history, color coding)
3. Multiple Named Environment Configurations

### Phase 2 (Medium Impact, Medium Complexity)
1. System Tray Icon and Native Notifications
2. Project Grouping, Tagging, and Searching
3. Git Integration (basic status and actions)

### Phase 3 (High Impact, Higher Complexity)
1. Enhanced Terminal Emulation
2. Docker Integration
3. Auto-Update Functionality

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Requirements
- Maintain separation between main and renderer processes
- Use IPC for all cross-process communication
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data
- Follow existing code patterns and styling

### Performance Requirements
- Background operations should not impact UI responsiveness
- Terminal emulation should handle large output efficiently
- Search and filtering should be fast even with many projects
- Update checking should be non-blocking

### Security Requirements
- Terminal execution should respect system security policies
- Git operations should use secure authentication methods
- Auto-updates should verify signatures and integrity
- File operations should be sandboxed appropriately
